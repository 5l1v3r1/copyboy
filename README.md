Copyboy is the Los Angeles Times Data Desk fork of GitHub's Campfire bot, [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot). It is aware of all Internet traditions.

This version is designed to be deployed on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and experienced in IRC via [grove.io](http://grove.io).

## Features

In addition to an array of standard hubot features, copyboy knows a few new tricks.
